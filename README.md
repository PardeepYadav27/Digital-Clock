**Step 1 (HTML Code):
**
A digital clock means it shows time in number format. JavaScript receives real-time out of your tool and presentations it at the website. And this post is about how JavaScript gets the time and displays it using some basic methods. Basically, this is a real-time digital clock, which means you can see time in numbers with hours, minutes, and second. And the clock usually works, so you don't need to refresh the website to see the updated time.
To get started, we will first need to create a basic HTML file. In this file, we will include the main structure for our digital clock.

After creating the files just paste the following codes into your file. Make sure to save your HTML document with a .html extension, so that it can be properly viewed in a web browser.

This is the basic structure of our digital clock using HTML, and now we can move on to styling it using CSS.
Once the basic HTML structure of the digital clock is in place, the next step is to add styling to the digital clock using CSS. CSS allows us to control the visual appearance of the clock, including things like layout, color, and typography.
**Step 2 (CSS Code):
**
Next, we will create our CSS file. In this file, we will use some basic CSS rules to create our digital clock. We will also add some padding and margin properties to ensure that everything looks correct.

This will give our digital clock an upgraded presentation. Create a CSS file with the name of styles.css and paste the given codes into your CSS file. Remember that you must create a file with the .css extension.
**Step 3 (JavaScript Code):
**
Finally, we need to make our clock work by adding our JavaScript. Create a JavaScript file with the name of script.js and paste the given codes into your JavaScript file and make sure it's linked properly to your HTML document, so that the scripts are executed on the page. Remember, youâ€™ve to create a file with .js extension.
